Utilities and guides to make onboarding into @SentientAGI faster and easier.

## Project 1 — Sentient Quickstart (Environment Check)
**What it does:**  
A tiny Python script that checks your environment and creates a clean starter folder for new Sentient builders. It’s designed to reduce friction for first-time contributors.

**Why it matters:**  
Most people get stuck at setup. This gives them a quick “health check” and a ready workspace, so they can focus on contributing faster.

### How to use
1) Make sure Python 3 is installed.  
2) Download this repo (green **Code** button → **Download ZIP**), unzip anywhere.  
3) Double-click `sentient_quickstart.py` or run:
```bash
python3 sentient_quickstart.py
